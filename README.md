#Overkill aiming assistant

##Intro
This is a autoHotKey script for the online game OverWatch. It can auto-aim the adversaries when their HP bars appear.  To run the script, you should set your hero to default profile (i.e., default mouse sensitive). In addition to that, you ought to set your picture rendering to low and set  gamma brightness settings to default. 
This script works well for Soldier 76, Tracer, Bastion and Reaper.

Instructions are included in How-to. Since overkill performs differently on different hardwares, you may well need to adjust some parameters before it can be "overkill". Please read the instructions before using the script!


##History
* V1.2: Using pixel-level search, hence HP bar searching is faster and more accurate! Thank Ding for his contribution!
* V1.1: The searching scope of bars gets more accurate. Thus, HP bars searching is faster.
* V1.0: The first version of Overkill, congratulations!


##Call For Contribution
This script can't support different heros very well (e.g., Macree, Pharah, Widowmaker). You can contribute your aimming solution to be a part of this project.
