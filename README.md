# Overkill aiming assistant



## Intro
This is a autoHotKey script for the online game. It can auto-aim the adversaries when their HP bars appear.  To run the script, you should set your hero to default profile (i.e., default mouse sensitive). In addition to that, you ought to set your picture rendering to low and set gamma brightness settings to default. 

Instructions are included in How-to. Since overkill performs differently on different hardwares, you may well need to adjust some parameters before it can be "overkill". Please ***peruse*** the instructions before using the script!

Note! It is welcomed that you repost overkill at any other forums and platforms, but please attach the original link (i.e., https://github.com/xiaofen9/overkill)  



## History

**V2.0** : We release our new Overkill with proudness! We investigate many fancy functions and made many improvements. Thanks for contribution from contributors!
We mainly improve following aspects:

* Introduce new algorithm to mitigate aim shaking while there are multiple adversaries. Now, Overkill will choose the nearest bots to shoot from multiple adversaries.
* Add Update notifier, now it will check for update every time you open it and notify you if there is a new version.
*  Eliminate the screen size options, now it can detect and adapt your computer automatically, and you just need to press F1.
*  Code has been rewritten, now it is object-oriented and thus easy to read and redevelop. 
*  Fix bugs of the profile saver.


 **V1.4**: In this version, We revoke the Capslock trigger, which receives lots of complains. Now, it will start aiming as long as Lbutton of mouse is pressed. In addition to that, we add profile auto-saver, which means Overkill will save your settings like parameters in Shoot and Speed automatically. Other functions will be added soon.
 
 **V1.3**: In this version, We set the aim hotkey from Lbutton of mouse to Capslock. Now you can fire freely without overkill and activate Overkill when capslock were pressed. Then aimbot will be valid for about 1 seconds. During that time, overkill will work as long as you fire.
 
**V1.2**: Using pixel-level search, hence HP bar searching is faster and more accurate! Thank Ding for his contribution!

 **V1.1**: The searching scope of bars gets more accurate. Thus, HP bars searching is faster.
 
 **V1.0**: The first version of Overkill, congratulations!
